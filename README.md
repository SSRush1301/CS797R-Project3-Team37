This project utilizes the Model-View-ViewModel architecture to track the history of expressions calculated in a calculator page. This code is still a work in progress however it does have some good strides in where it has gotten. It properly tracks the expressions of the calculator page but only until navigated to the history page, then for some reason the binding does not update -- I'm still trying to resolve this issue.
